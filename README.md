### NBA Networks

This objective of this project is to use machine learning to examine trends about NBA players and teams. Although I plan to develop statistical models for future performance of both NCAA prospects and current NBA players, I am also hoping to levearage a graph-based machine learning approach to examine player-team transitions like free agency movement and trades.

Drawing on data from 30,000+ college and 4,450 NBA players, Daniel (2020) uses 27 features to develop a binary classifier to predict likelihood of NCAA players getting drafted. He finds games played, 2P% and FT% to be the most robust predictors with assists, blocks, steals, minutes and games started in the next tier.
